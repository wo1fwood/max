**Version 1.03 for Mac OS X, (G4, G5 and Intel) and Win XP\
\
This version should be compatible with Max/MSP 4.6 as an "universal" application. \
Some bug fixes have been done, also a gain control has been added to vbap input. \
Thanks to Cristophe Baratay for this work.  \
\
**Version 1.01 for Mac OS X\
\
Fixed a bug in 2D loudspeaker pair choosing. This made vbap to choose wrong loudspeaker pairs occasionally. This happened only if the loudspeakers were not immersing the listener, e.g. loudspeakers were only at directions  30, 0, -30 of azimuth. \
\
**Version 1.00b for Mac OS X\
\
Compiled for OS X with CW 7. Special thanks to jasch and Nathan Wolek for helping in porting. \
\
vbap inlets take also floats.\
\
2d vbap should not output negative gains anymore in any condition. \
\
\
\
\
**Version 0.99\
\
matrix~ no longer supported, using the matrix~ appearing in \
Max4.0/MSP2.0 package. \
\
vbap object outputs the gains in format supported by the new matrix~. \
\
**Version 0.91\
\
A bug in gain factor calculation solved which produced\
NaNs as gain factors in some cases. \
\
\
**Version 0.9\
The vbap object allocated a small amount of memory that was never\
freed. This is now (9/00) fixed. Thanks for Richard Dudas for helping. }
