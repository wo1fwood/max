This is jg.granulate~, a granulation object for Max6. It also works in Max7
when running the app in 32bit mode.

Copy "jg.granulate~.mxo" into the "Max6/Cycling '74/msp-externals" folder.
Copy the "jg.granulate-help" folder into the "Max6/Cycling '74/msp-help" folder.

(This object also works in Max/MSP 4.6. Contact me if you want a
4.6-compatible version of "jg.granulate~.maxhelp".)
